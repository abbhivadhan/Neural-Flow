4. WHEN external events occur (emails, notifications, calendar changes) THEN the system SHALL intelligently prioritize and suggest task adjustments
5. WHEN a user is approaching a deadline THEN the system SHALL automatically reorganize priorities and suggest time-blocking strategies

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Content Generation and Enhancement

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want AI to help me generate, enhance, and optimize my work output, so that I can produce higher quality results in less time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
