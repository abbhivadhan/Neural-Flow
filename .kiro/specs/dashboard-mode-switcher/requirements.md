# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a mode switcher button to the dashboard that allows users to toggle between different dashboard modes, specifically "Coding Mode" and "Meeting Mode". Each mode will optimize the dashboard layout and content for different work contexts, improving user productivity and focus.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to switch my dashboard to coding mode, so that I can see development-focused widgets and tools that help me code more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the mode switcher button THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with available modes
2. WHEN the user selects "Coding Mode" THEN the dashboard SHALL show coding-related widgets (code metrics, recent commits, active branches, etc.)
3. WHEN in coding mode THEN the system SHALL persist this preference across browser sessions
4. WHEN in coding mode THEN the dashboard SHALL use a layout optimized for development workflows

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to switch my dashboard to meeting mode, so that I can see collaboration-focused information during meetings and discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Meeting Mode" THEN the dashboard SHALL show meeting-related widgets (team status, shared documents, calendar, etc.)
2. WHEN in meeting mode THEN the system SHALL hide or minimize coding-specific widgets
3. WHEN in meeting mode THEN the dashboard SHALL use a layout optimized for presentation and collaboration
4. WHEN switching to meeting mode THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust widget sizes for better visibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the mode switcher to be easily accessible and visually clear, so that I can quickly change modes without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the mode switcher button SHALL be prominently displayed in the header or toolbar
2. WHEN hovering over the mode switcher THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating the current mode
3. WHEN the mode changes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (animation, notification, or highlight)
4. WHEN switching modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and not cause jarring layout shifts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my dashboard mode preference to be remembered, so that I don't have to manually switch modes every time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches modes THEN the system SHALL save the preference to local storage
2. WHEN the user returns to the dashboard THEN the system SHALL automatically load their last selected mode
3. WHEN no previous preference exists THEN the system SHALL default to coding mode
4. IF local storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to session-based preference storage
